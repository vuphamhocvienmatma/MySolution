# Project Readme: .NET 9 Clean Architecture API

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the project's architecture, development workflows, and common services. It's intended for developers joining the project to get up to speed quickly.

---
## 1. Core Architecture üèõÔ∏è

This project is built upon **Clean Architecture** principles to create a decoupled, maintainable, and testable system. The core idea is that business logic should not depend on technical implementation details. The system also includes an **API Gateway** to act as a single, secure entry point.

**The Dependency Rule:** `WebAPI` ‚Üí `Infrastructure` ‚Üí `Application` ‚Üí `Domain`. The `ApiGateway` is a separate entry point that forwards traffic to the `WebAPI`.

### Project Layers

* **`ApiGateway`**: The single entry point for all client requests. It handles cross-cutting concerns like Authentication, Rate Limiting, CORS, and Security Headers before forwarding traffic to the appropriate backend service.
* **`Domain`**: The heart of the application. It contains the core business logic, entities, and domain events. It has **no dependencies** on other layers.
* **`Application`**: Contains the application's use cases, orchestrated via the **CQRS pattern** (Commands and Queries). It defines interfaces for infrastructure concerns but does not implement them.
* **`Infrastructure`**: Implements the interfaces defined in the `Application` layer. It contains all the technical details like database access (EF Core, Dapper), caching (Redis), and background job processing (Hangfire).
* **`WebAPI`**: The backend service that contains the core business logic endpoints. It trusts that incoming requests have been vetted by the ApiGateway.

### Key Technologies

| Area | Technology / Pattern |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture** | Clean Architecture, DDD, CQRS, API Gateway (YARP) |
| **Database** | EF Core, Dapper, MongoDB |
| **Messaging** | MassTransit, RabbitMQ, Outbox Pattern |
| **Caching** | Multi-Layer Cache (In-Memory + Redis) |
| **Background Jobs**| Hangfire |
| **Real-time** | SignalR |
| **API Security** | JWT, Rate Limiting, Multi-Tenancy, Security Headers |
| **Logging** | Serilog with Correlation ID |

## 2. API Gateway (YARP) üö™

The API Gateway is the public-facing entry point for the entire system. All clients (web, mobile) should only communicate with the Gateway.

### Request Flow
The standard request flow is as follows:
`Client` ‚Üí `API Gateway (YARP)` ‚Üí `WebAPI Service`

The Gateway is responsible for initial validation and security, while the WebAPI service handles the business logic.

### How to Add a New Route
All routing is configured within the `appsettings.json` file of the `ApiGateway` project. To expose a new set of endpoints (e.g., for "Products"):

1.  **Open `src/ApiGateway/appsettings.json`**.
2.  Add a new entry under the `ReverseProxy:Routes` section.

**Example: Adding a route for a new `Products` controller.**
```json
"ReverseProxy": {
  "Routes": {
    // ... existing routes for auth and users
    "products-route": {
      "ClusterId": "api-cluster",
      "Order": 2, // Use Order to control which route matches first
      "Match": {
        "Path": "/api/products/{**catch-all}"
      },
      // Apply the same security policies as other secure routes
      "Authentication": {
        "Policy": "Default"
      },
      "RateLimiter": {
        "Policy": "fixed"
      }
    }
  },
  "Clusters": {
    // The cluster usually remains the same
    "api-cluster": {
      "Destinations": {
        "destination1": {
          "Address": "http://web-api:8080/"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 3. Developer Workflows üë®‚Äçüíª

### Database Management with EF Core
All commands should be run from the root of the repository.
* **Creating a Migration:** After changing a domain entity, create a migration to capture the schema change.
    ```bash
    dotnet ef migrations add <YourMigrationName> --project src/Infrastructure --startup-project src/WebAPI
    ```
* **Applying Migrations:** To apply pending migrations to the database.
    ```bash
    dotnet ef database update --startup-project src/WebAPI
    ```

### How to Add a New Feature (e.g., "Create Product")
This workflow demonstrates the vertical slice approach.

1.  **Domain Layer:**
    * Create the entity file: `src/Domain/Entities/Product.cs`.
        ```csharp
        public class Product : BaseAuditableEntity, IMustHaveTenant
        {
            public string TenantId { get; set; }
            public required string Name { get; set; }
            public decimal Price { get; set; }
        }
        ```
2.  **Application Layer:**
    * Create a new folder: `src/Application/Products/Commands/CreateProduct`.
    * Define the command: `CreateProductCommand.cs`.
        ```csharp
        public record CreateProductCommand(string Name, decimal Price) : IRequest<Guid>;
        ```
    * Define the validator: `CreateProductCommandValidator.cs`.
        ```csharp
        public class CreateProductCommandValidator : AbstractValidator<CreateProductCommand> { /* ... rules ... */ }
        ```
    * Implement the handler: `CreateProductCommandHandler.cs`. This contains the core logic.
        ```csharp
        public class CreateProductCommandHandler : IRequestHandler<CreateProductCommand, Guid>
        {
            private readonly IApplicationDbContext _context;
            public CreateProductCommandHandler(IApplicationDbContext context) => _context = context;

            public async Task<Guid> Handle(CreateProductCommand request, CancellationToken ct)
            {
                var product = new Product { /* ... */ };
                _context.Products.Add(product);
                // The Outbox message is added automatically if needed via other mechanisms
                await _context.SaveChangesAsync(ct);
                return product.Id;
            }
        }
        ```
3.  **Infrastructure Layer:**
    * Update `IApplicationDbContext` and `ApplicationDbContext` to include `DbSet<Product> Products { get; }`.
    * Create an EF Core configuration file: `src/Infrastructure/Persistence/Configurations/ProductConfiguration.cs`.
        ```csharp
        public class ProductConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<Product>
        {
            public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<Product> builder)
            {
                builder.ToTable("Products");
                builder.HasKey(p => p.Id);
                builder.Property(p => p.Name).HasMaxLength(200).IsRequired();
            }
        }
        ```
4.  **WebAPI Layer:**
    * Add a new method to `ProductsController.cs`.
        ```csharp
        [HttpPost]
        public async Task<IActionResult> CreateProduct([FromBody] CreateProductCommand command)
        {
            var productId = await Mediator.Send(command);
            return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetProductById), new { id = productId }, new { id = productId });
        }
        ```
5.  **Final Step:** Create and apply the EF Core migration.

## 4. How to Use Common Services üõ†Ô∏è

This project provides several shared services to handle common tasks consistently. You can inject these interfaces into your handlers or other services.

### `ICurrentUserService`
Provides information about the authenticated user making the request.
* **Purpose:** To get the current user's ID, Tenant ID, email, etc., without accessing `HttpContext` directly in your business logic.
* **Usage (in a Command Handler):**
    ```csharp
    private readonly ICurrentUserService _currentUser;
    public MyHandler(ICurrentUserService currentUser) => _currentUser = currentUser;

    public async Task Handle(...)
    {
        var userId = _currentUser.UserId;
        var tenantId = _currentUser.TenantId;
        // The CreatedBy field is usually set automatically in the DbContext SaveChangesAsync override.
    }
    ```

### `ICacheService`
A multi-layer cache service (In-Memory + Redis) for high-performance data retrieval.
* **Purpose:** To cache data that is read frequently but changes infrequently. It automatically handles checking L1 (memory) then L2 (Redis) before hitting the database.
* **Usage (in a Query Handler or MediatR Behavior):** The `CachingBehavior` already uses this. To use it manually:
    ```csharp
    private readonly ICacheService _cache;
    public MyQueryHandler(ICacheService cache) => _cache = cache;

    public async Task Handle(...)
    {
        string cacheKey = "my-unique-data-key";
        var data = await _cache.GetOrCreateAsync(
            cacheKey,
            () => _dbContext.Products.ToListAsync(), // This function only runs on a cache miss
            TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10)
        );
        return data;
    }
    ```

### `IHttpClientService`
A generic client for making external HTTP calls using Flurl, with built-in resilience via Polly.
* **Purpose:** To call third-party APIs in a standardized, testable, and resilient way.
* **Usage (in a Command Handler):**
    ```csharp
    private readonly IHttpClientService _httpClient;
    public MyPaymentHandler(IHttpClientService httpClient) => _httpClient = httpClient;

    public async Task Handle(...)
    {
        var response = await _httpClient.PostAsync<PaymentRequest, PaymentResponse>(
            clientName: "PaymentGateway", // Must be configured in Program.cs
            requestUri: "process-payment",
            data: new PaymentRequest { /* ... */ }
        );
        // ... process the response
    }
    ```

## 5. Background Jobs with Hangfire üïí

Hangfire is used for reliable background job processing.
* **Purpose:** To offload long-running, non-critical tasks from the API request thread (e.g., sending emails, processing reports, syncing data).
* **Dashboard:** You can monitor jobs at the `/hangfire` endpoint.

### How to Schedule a Job

1.  **Fire-and-Forget:** Executes once, immediately in the background. Good for tasks like sending a welcome email.
    ```csharp
    // Inject IBackgroundJobClient
    private readonly IBackgroundJobClient _jobClient;

    // Inside a handler
    _jobClient.Enqueue<IEmailService>(emailService => emailService.SendWelcomeEmail(userId));
    ```

2.  **Delayed:** Executes once after a specified delay.
    ```csharp
    _jobClient.Schedule<IReportingService>(
        reportingService => reportingService.GenerateMonthlyReport(tenantId),
        TimeSpan.FromHours(2)
    );
    ```

3.  **Recurring:** Executes repeatedly on a CRON schedule. This is how the `ProcessOutboxMessagesJob` is configured in `Program.cs`.
    ```csharp
    // In Program.cs
    RecurringJob.AddOrUpdate<ProcessOutboxMessagesJob>(
        "process-outbox-messages",
        job => job.ExecuteAsync(),
        Cron.Minutely // Runs every minute
    );
    ```
